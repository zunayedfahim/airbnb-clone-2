Landing page of Airbnb Website built with ReactJS along with Tailwind CSS. 

**Few problems that I faced during this built: 
1. Couldn't melt the "after content" while hovering on a definite element in the search box.
2. Search Modal closes while I try to click on the modal. This is because I used onBLur attribute on the button. 

Would appreciate any help from developer to solve these problems. Peace ✌️
