Landing page of Airbnb Website built with ReactJS along with Tailwind CSS. 

**Few problems that I faced during this built: 
1. Couldn't melt the after content while hovering on a definite element on the search box.
2. Search Modal closes while I try to click on any button of the modal. This is because I used onBLur attribute on the button.

Would appreciate any help from developer to solve these problems. Peace ✌️
